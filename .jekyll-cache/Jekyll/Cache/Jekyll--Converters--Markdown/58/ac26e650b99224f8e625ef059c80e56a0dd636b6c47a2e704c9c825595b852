<p>Hola! geeks and nerds. In this post I will talk about 2 projects that I am
thinking to do recently. I like the new Planet of the Apes series movie. I still
remember the scene when Caesar told his son: <strong>‚ÄúThink before you act, son‚Äù</strong> in
the second movie <strong>Dawn of the Planet of the Apes</strong>.</p>

<p>In the programming world, the reference changes to ‚ÄúThink before you code‚Äù. And
if you google it, you will find many posts to explain this principle. I won‚Äôt
talk about it in this post, it goes beyond my brain.</p>

<p>This post is about thinking 2 projects and see how far I could go. In the other
words, this is a challenge for myself.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Each Project may integrate some of the skills I know, like python(Flask and
Django framework, extension packages like numpy, pandas and matplotlib),
JavaScript, SQL/NoSQL, AWS(API Gateway, Lambda, EC2 etc.)</li>
  <li>Each Project may have several stages, from one stage to another stage, I want
to try to explain why using cloud services is convenient if there is a chance,
what features of a programming language I can use to make the code more clear
and how to solve the problems I met. So at beginning, the project maybe very simple.</li>
  <li>During this process, I also want to train my brain to get better understanding
about these skills.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="2project-1---a-simple-python-sqlnosql-client">2.Project 1 - A simple python SQL/NoSQL client</h3>
<p>When I use AWS RDS for study purpose, I need to download related client software
to connect to the database like AWS suggested.</p>

<p><a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_ConnectToInstance.html" target="\_blank">Connecting to a DB Instance Running the MySQL Database Engine</a>  <br />
<a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_ConnectToPostgreSQLInstance.html" target="\_blank">Connecting to a DB Instance Running the PostgreSQL Database Engine</a></p>

<p>For one reason I would like to keep my compute lean. For another reason, it is a
good practice to integrate with AWS services. In my thought, this simple SQL/NoSQL
client will only support for several key SQL/NoSQL commands. This project may
include below stages:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Stage 1: only supports for several MySQL key commands, run with CLI (Command Line Interface),
only use Python with AWS MySQL.</li>
  <li>Stage 2: supports for AWS PostgreSQL, Amazon DynamoDB, may involve code refactoring.</li>
  <li>Stage 3: integrate with  Amazon API Gateway, AWS Lambda, JavaScript, HTML, make
an online SQL/NoSQL client.</li>
  <li>Stage 4: No clue so far.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="3project-2---a-project-with-no-name-so-far">3.Project 2 - A project with no name so far</h3>
<p>I am not sure if I should call this a project or a solution. I want to put
python plots or excel plots in the blog when I write some posts related to Data Science.
But I also want to include some AWS cloud services in this solution. So the requirements
are not very clear now, it‚Äôs just a blur idea. But I think I could go somewhere with this idea.</p>

<p>Let‚Äôs see what will happen!</p>
