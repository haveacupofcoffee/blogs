<p>  Hej,Hej! geeks and nerds. In the last post I introduced how to write your blog with Jekyll and Github page. It’s time to link to your CV unless you have concerns about your privacy.
  Since I was using minima theme of Jekyll, one way to do this is writing your CV information in <code class="highlighter-rouge">about.md</code> file. Then when you click on <code class="highlighter-rouge">about</code> in the navigation bar, it will show your CV. But it is not clear for the viewers unless you change the name <code class="highlighter-rouge">about</code> to <code class="highlighter-rouge">CV</code> or some other names which are obvious to the viewers. Here I will keep <code class="highlighter-rouge">about </code> page as I want to put some information about the blog project. I will add a new navigation link near the <code class="highlighter-rouge">about</code> navigation link to present my CV.
  To write a CV, the content of the CV is important, but the structure and the appearance is more important. You have to make it organized to give the viewer a great first impression. There are many CV templates online, using them will make your work easier.</p>

<p>  You could download the original CV template I am using from the link below:<br />

<h3 id="2add-cv-files-to-the-project">2.Add CV files to the project</h3>
<p>  To add the CV files to the blog, we need to follow the structure of the project. Here we add file <code class="highlighter-rouge">cv.html</code> in <code class="highlighter-rouge">_layout</code> folder. This file is the layout template of the CV. To simplify at the beginning, I didn’t set the layout value of this file as default. The <code class="highlighter-rouge">cv.file</code> uses the structure of the <code class="highlighter-rouge">index.html</code> from the original CV template you downloaded from the above link. You could check this flie by clicking the link below:<br />
<a href="https://github.com/haveacupofcoffee/blogs/blob/master/\_layouts/cv.html">cv.html</a><br />
  The <code class="highlighter-rouge">cv.html</code> is just the presentation of the CV, I put the content of the CV in <code class="highlighter-rouge">englishcv.md</code> file. In this file, I defined the <code class="highlighter-rouge">title</code> varaible to <code class="highlighter-rouge">CV(EN)</code> which will be showed in the navigation bar as my CV navigation link.

<h3 id="3-problems-need-to-be-fixed-later">3. Problems need to be fixed later</h3>
<p>We added CV files in the project, if you try it, it works well. But there are some problems we need to fix later.</p>
<ul>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">cv.html</code>: this file has its own css and js scripts. and it didn’t use the default layout, that’s why when we redirect to the CV page, there is no navigation bar and footer bar like other blog pages. We need to fix this later.</li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">cv.html</code>: download pdf function is not working so far.</li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">cv.html</code>：go to top function is not working on some browsers like chrome.</li>
</ul>
